Osimis Web Viewer plugin
========================

.. contents::

This plugin by Osimis extends Orthanc with a Web viewer of medical
images, with more advanced features than the basic :ref:`Orthanc Web
viewer plugin <webviewer>`. The Osimis plugin adds tools for
measuring, for viewing multiple series, and for split-pane.

Importantly, contrarily to the basic Orthanc Web viewer, **CE
marking** is available. By buying such a CE marking, this viewer can
be used for diagnostic purpose.

For general information, check out the `official homepage of the
plugin
