Serve Folders plugin
====================

This **official** plugin enables Orthanc to serve additional folders
from the filesystem using its embedded Web server.

This plugin is extremely useful to create new Web applications on the
top of the REST API of Orthanc, as it allows to fulfill the
`same-origin policy
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy>`__ without setting
up a reverse proxy.
