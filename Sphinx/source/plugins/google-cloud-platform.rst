Google Cloud Platform plugin
============================

.. contents::

Osimis provides a `dedicated plugin
<https://bitbucket.org/osimis/orthanc-gcp/src>`__ to interface Orthanc
with Healthcare API of `Google Cloud Platform
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Platform>`__ using
:ref:`DICOMweb <dicomweb>`. This plugin notably enables the upload of
DICOM images through STOW-RS, the querying of the cloud content
through QIDO-RS, and the retrieval of remote content through WADO-RS.
These operations can be scripted through the REST API of Orthanc.
