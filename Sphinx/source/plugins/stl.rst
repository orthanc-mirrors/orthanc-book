STL plugin for Orthanc
======================

.. contents::


Overview
--------

This **official** plugin by the `ICTEAM institute of UCLouvain
<https://orthanc.uclouvain.be/>`__ extends Orthanc with support for
`Encapsulated 3D Manufacturing Model IODs
<https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_A.85.html>`_,
for the moment limited to `STL files
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)>`__.

The plugin allows to attach STL files to existing DICOM studies and to
generate a STL mesh from structure sets (i.e., DICOM RT-STRUCT) or
from `NIfTI binary volumes
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging_Informatics_Technology_Initiative>`__.
The description of these features is `available as a paper
<https://doi.org/10.1145/3632047.3632051>`__.

**For researchers**: `Please cite this paper
<https://doi.org/10.1145/3632047.3632051>`__.
