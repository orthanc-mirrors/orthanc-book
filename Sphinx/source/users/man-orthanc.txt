NAME
       Orthanc	- Lightweight, RESTful DICOM server for healthcare and medical
       research

SYNOPSIS
       Orthanc [OPTION]... [CONFIGURATION]

DESCRIPTION
       Orthanc, lightweight, RESTful DICOM server for healthcare  and  medical
       research.

       The  "CONFIGURATION"  argument  can be a single file or a directory. In
       the case of a directory, all the JSON files it contains will be merged.
       If no configuration path is given on the command line, a set of default
       parameters is used. Please refer to the Orthanc Book for the  full  in‐
       structions   about   how	  to   use   Orthanc   <https://orthanc.uclou‐
       vain.be/book/>.

       Pay attention to the fact that the order of the options	is  important.
       Options	are read left to right. In particular, options such as "--ver‐
       bose" can reset the value of other log-related options that  were  read
       before.

       The recommended set of options to debug DICOM communications is "--ver‐
       bose --trace-dicom --logfile=dicom.log"

       --help display this help and exit

       --logdir=[dir]

	      dumped to stderr)

	      dumps to stdout)

       --verbose
	      be verbose in logs

       --trace

       --upgrade
	      allow  Orthanc  to  upgrade  the version of the database (beware
	      that the database will become incompatible with former  versions
	      of Orthanc)

	      tion of Orthanc

       --openapi=[file]

	      dumps to stdout)

       --cheatsheet=[file]

	      "-", dumps to stdout)
