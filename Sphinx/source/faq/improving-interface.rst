Orthanc Explorer is not user-friendly enough for my use
=======================================================

Orthanc is designed as a lightweight service for medical imaging,
where the word *service* must be understood in the sense of
`service-oriented architectures
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture>`__.  As
a consequence, Orthanc is conceived as a robust back-end server
(command-line) that aims to provide the most simple and generic
support of DICOM. To state it differently, **the primary focus of the
Orthanc project is not on the user interface**.

However, Orthanc comes out-of-the-box with :ref:`Orthanc Explorer
<orthanc-explorer>`, its default Web user interface. **Orthanc
Explorer is designed for development, low-level purpose.** It is
also used by the development team to test the features of Orthanc as
they get introduced in the REST API. Orthanc Explorer is mainly
targeted towards an English-speaking technical audience (notably
system/network engineers, `PACS
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_archiving_and_communication_system>`__
managers, medical physicists, and researchers).

**Non-technical audience** (physicists, patients, administrative
staff...) **shall have a look at** :ref:`Orthanc Explorer 2 <orthanc-explorer-2>`
**plugin** that provides a more friendly user interface including:
  
- translations
- modification and tunable anonymization
- configurable interface

Once integrated with the `orthanc-auth-service <https://github.com/orthanc-team/orthanc-auth-service>`__ 
companion web service, Orthanc Explorer 2 also offers:

- user permissions
- web diffusion to patients/physicians


Finally, you may also have a look to the following **related projects**:

* In 2017-2018, a team of Master students from `ULi√®ge
  <https://www.uliege.be/>`__ has done some work about creating a
  revamped version of Orthanc Explorer. Check out the `related
  discussion
  <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/orthanc-users/oOyKTmfs-J0/B6eyBJcvCAAJ>`__
  on the Orthanc Users forum.

* `Orthanc Tools <https://github.com/salimkanoun/Orthanc_Tools>`__, a
  desktop Java interface around the REST API of Orthanc by Salim
  Kanoun. Orthanc Tools was notably showcased during `OrthancCon 2019
  <https://www.orthanc-server.com/static.php?page=conference-schedule>`__.
  
* `OrthancToolsJS <https://github.com/salimkanoun/Orthanc-Tools-JS>`__
  is the successor of the now-deprecated Orthanc Tools. This Web
  interface was also created by Salim Kanoun. For more information,
  including link to a demo server, `check out the announcement

* `Menba <https://github.com/fidelio33b/menba>`__ is a Web interface
  built on the top of the REST API of Orthanc. It is written using
  `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`__ and `Bootstrap
  <https://getbootstrap.com/>`__, and takes advantage of `Celery
  <https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/getting-started/introduction.html>`__
  and `AMQP
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Message_Queuing_Protocol>`__
  to handle the asynchronous tasks.
