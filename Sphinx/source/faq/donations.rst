.. _donations:

How can I donate money to the project?
======================================

The Orthanc project **does not accept donations for now**. We think
it's a poor business model for running an open source project as it
suggests the developers are working for charity.

If you are a **commercial company** that builds upon the Orthanc
ecosystem for your own products, please contribute by buying the
:ref:`professional services offered by our community
<support-freelancers>`.

If you want to **help the project financially as an end-user**, you
can approach some of the companies offering commercial support for
Orthanc and engage their services. Doing so creates a healthy
ecosystem around the project where companies are encouraged to
contribute their resources to improve the project to create a larger
pool of potential customers wanting their services. A :ref:`list of
freelancers <support-freelancers>` is available in this Orthanc Book.

We appreciate **positive feedback** on our project as well. If you are
on Twitter, send us a tweet to `@OrthancServer
<https://twitter.com/OrthancServer>`__. That helps raise awareness of
our project so others can benefit from it as well.

Finally, don't forget to have a look :ref:`other ways to contribute
<contributing>` to the Orthanc project.
