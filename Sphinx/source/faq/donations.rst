How can I donate money to the project?
======================================

The Orthanc project **does not accept donations for now**. We think
it's a poor business model for running an open source project as it
suggests the developers are working for charity.

If you are a **commercial company** that builds upon the Orthanc
ecosystem for your own products, please contribute by buying the
`corporate services provided by Osimis
<https://www.osimis.io/en/services.html>`__.

If you want to **help the project financially as an end-user**, you
can approach some of the companies offering commercial support for
Orthanc and engage their services. Doing so creates a healthy
ecosystem around the project where companies are encouraged to
contribute their resources to improve the project to create a larger
pool of potential customers wanting their services. A list of
`freelancers or volunteers providing custom assistance
<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/orthanc-users/vWpHWFkYiWI/vB5eRM1WCQAJ>`__
is available on the Orthanc Users forum.

We appreciate **positive feedback** on our project as well. If you are
on Twitter, send us a tweet to `@OrthancServer
<https://twitter.com/OrthancServer>`__. That helps raise awareness of
our project so others can benefit from it as well.

Finally, don't forget to have a look :ref:`other ways to contribute
<contributing>` to the Orthanc project.
