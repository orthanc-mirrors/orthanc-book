How can I donate money to the project?
======================================

Since February 2022, you are invited to fund the Orthanc project
through its `Open Collective <https://opencollective.com/orthanc>`__
page.  The funds collected there will help us maintain Orthanc,
release new features and answer questions on the Orthanc Users Group.

If you are a **commercial company** that builds upon the Orthanc
ecosystem for your own products, you may also contribute by buying the
:ref:`professional services offered by our community
<support-freelancers>`. Doing so creates a healthy
ecosystem around the project where companies are encouraged to
contribute their resources to improve the project to create a larger
pool of potential customers wanting their services. A :ref:`list of
freelancers <support-freelancers>` is available in this Orthanc Book.

We appreciate **positive feedback** on our project as well. If you are
on Twitter, send us a tweet to `@OrthancServer
<https://twitter.com/OrthancServer>`__. That helps raise awareness of
our project so others can benefit from it as well.

Finally, don't forget to have a look :ref:`other ways to contribute
<contributing>` to the Orthanc project.
