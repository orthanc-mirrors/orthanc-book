Orthanc versioning
==================

Each release of Orthanc is identified by a version that is made of three parts: ``API.MAJOR.MINOR`` (e.g. 0.5.1).

* API (currently, 0) changes when the REST API is refactored.
* MAJOR changes when a new major feature is introduced (either in the REST API or in the DICOM support), when an incompatibility in the database schema is introduced, or when an important refactoring is achieved.
* MINOR changes after each introduction of a minor feature, after a bugfix, or after a speed or GUI improvement. It also changes when an experimental feature is introduced.
