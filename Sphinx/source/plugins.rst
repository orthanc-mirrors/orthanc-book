Overview
--------

The core of Orthanc can be extended through **plugins**. A plugin
takes the form of a shared library (``.DLL`` under Windows, ``.so``
under GNU/Linux, ``.dylib`` under Apple OS X...). A plugin can do
various things, among others:

* Serving new **Web applications** that have full access to the REST
  API of Orthanc, which makes easy to handle DICOM images from
  JavaScript code.
* Replacing **the way DICOM images are decoded** (e.g. the official
  :ref:`Web viewer plugin <webviewer>` introduces the decoding of
  JPEG2000 images, which is not available in the core of Orthanc).
* Replacing the default **database back-end** of Orthanc (that is
  built upon SQLite) by another (:ref:`PostgreSQL <postgresql>`,
  :ref:`MySQL <mysql>`, SQL Server...).
* Creating **new REST APIs** on the top of the Orthanc built-in API (as in
  in the official :ref:`DICOMweb <dicomweb>` plugin).
* **Reacting** to the arrival of new DICOM images or other
  DICOM-related events so as to carry on automated processing.
* ...

Developers external to the official Orthanc project are :ref:`invited
to contribute <contributing>` to the C/C++ part of Orthanc by creating
third-party plugins.  A specific section of the Orthanc Book explains
:ref:`how to create new Orthanc plugins <creating-plugins>`.
