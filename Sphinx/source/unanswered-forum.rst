Old unanswered questions from Orthanc Users
===========================================

.. contents::


Rationale
---------

This page lists the questions (since 2018) that are still looking for
an answer on the `Orthanc Users discussion group
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/orthanc-users>`__.

Threads that are not answered in a satisfying manner after a few weeks
are indexed here by the core maintainers of Orthanc, in order to avoid
forgetting them if they get buried under many new threads.

If you consider that another old thread is missing in this list
(**wait at least 2 months**), you can ping by replying onto the
forgotten thread, asking to index it on this page of the Orthanc Book.

Conversely, if you feel that some thread listed on this page is
already properly answered, reply to the thread by saying that you are
happy with the answers that have been gathered. We would then be able
to remove the question from this page.
