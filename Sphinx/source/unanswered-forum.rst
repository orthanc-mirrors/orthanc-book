Unanswered questions on the discussion groups
=============================================

The primary place to ask support about Orthanc is on `our Discourse
forum <https://discourse.orthanc-server.org/>`__. Unfortunately,
because of the huge number of support requests we have to deal with on
a daily basis, the core Orthanc team might wrongly assume that a topic
can be considered as resolved.

To avoid missing a pending support request, we automatically `publish
the list of topics that we still consider as active on Discourse
<https://orthanc.uclouvain.be/discourse/>`__. **Our support efforts
are primarily targeted at this list of topics**. Don't expect any
further support if your topic is not part of this list.


*Remark:* The older version of this page mentioning the former
"Orthanc Users" Google Group `can still be found on Mercurial
<https://orthanc.uclouvain.be/hg/orthanc-book/file/2cc02026ecbf/Sphinx/source/unanswered-forum.rst>`__.
